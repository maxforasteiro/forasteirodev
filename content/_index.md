## Hey there! My name is Max Forasteiro :wave:

I'm a DevOps Engineer at SumUp with more than 10 years of experience developing software.
I like to say that I enable teams to deliver software solutions through platforms and automation.

Other than that, I like to cycle and boulder when I have some free time.

You can find me over [GitHub](https://github.com/maxforasteiro/) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/maxforasteiro/).
